# 📚 BookShelf

A simple SwiftUI app to track your reading progress, built to showcase **SwiftData** and modern **SwiftUI** features introduced in iOS 17+.

---

## ✨ Features
- **SwiftData Persistence**  
  Uses `@Model`, `@Query`, and `modelContainer(for:)` for clean, boilerplate‑free persistence.

- **Reading Progress**  
  Track progress by chapters, with automatic percentage calculation.

- **Dynamic Star Ratings**  
  Tap to set ratings with a star‑based system that renders beautifully in the list.

- **Modern SwiftUI Views**
  - `NavigationStack` for navigation.
  - `ProgressView` to visualize reading progress.
  - `Picker` for selecting chapters quickly.
  - Responsive UI for nil values (e.g., “No Rating”, “Not Started”).

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Swift 5.9+**
- **SwiftUI (iOS 17+)**
